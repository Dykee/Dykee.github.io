From the rise of sea levels, carbon admission, and rising global temperatures, the change in our climate has had astounding effects on all terrestrial ecosystems. Changes in our atmosphere as early as the middle 1700’s has affected agricultural production globally across time and will continue to affect agricultural production for years to come. That being said our project <em>Visualizing The Effects of Climate Change: Cases Studies in Africa</em> is designed to map these changes in global temperature, precipitation, and crop yields as far back as possible. This project extends the work of scholars Andrew Challinor, Tim Wheeler, Chris Garforth, Peter Craufurd, and Amir Kassam which you can find <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10584-007-9249-0.pdf">here</a>. Although this particular article will talk about specific crop yields across the African continent, our methods in data visualization and machine learning is prepared to tackle other regions of the world across time. </p><h2 id="methods">Methods</h2><p>This section should talk about the following: </p><ul><li>How does Data Visualization and Machine learning tackle this premise of the project better<!-- -->/different than other methods?</li><li>Talk about Linear Regression</li><li>Talk about Multiple Linear Regression</li><li>Talk about the libraries that were used in the project</li><li>Maybe show a screenshot of the libraries</li><li>Talk about the data transformation process (masking)</li><li>Maybe show Screenshots of this code</li></ul><h2 id="results-(think-about-renaming)">Results (Think about renaming)</h2><p>The image to your right constitutes the Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.

The linear fits are comparing global temperature data and crop yield data. While, the multilinear fits are comparing global temperature data, crop yields data, and precipitation data. We ran these regressions for all 5 crops that listed in the Challinor et al article, which you can find <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10584-007-9249-0.pdf">here</a>.
